SN hosted the SCOA heat of the CompassSport Cup and Trophy competitions at Long Valley North on 23 February. In addition to staging a very well delivered event for nearly 300 people, the team also put on a strong showing in the forest. 

SN beat TVOC in the Cup (larger clubs) competition and will be heading to the dunes at South Gare, Redcar for the final on Sun 14 September. Thanks to all those who ran and/or helped on the day. See the results pages for full details.
