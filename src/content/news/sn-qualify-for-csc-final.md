The SN team had an emphatic victory over TVOC at the SCOA regional qualifier at Rushall Woods on 13th March. Full results details are here, and there are also some good photos linked from the BKO web site. Thank you to all who ran.

The final is at Devilla &amp; Tulliallan in central Scotland on Sunday 16th October.
