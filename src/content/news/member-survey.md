Thank you to the more than 60 members who responded - the survey is now closed. The Club paid the required fee to ensure that we can see ALL responses to the survey (contrary to what was implied in SNaggers). The Committee will review the full range of responses and decide whether to make any changes to our training activity schedule. For the time being weekly summer training remains on Wednesday evenings unless the web site details specifically state otherwise.

            

	    		
    		    

Based on the survey responses it is likely that we will host some future training sessions (commencing winter 2021/22) on evenings other than Wednesdays so that more/different people are able to attend, but we won't be able to please everyone all the time!

If you are not on the email distribution list, and would like to be, please contact the Membership Secretary. If you believe you were already on the list but did not receive the survey email, again please contact the Membership Secretary (but please check your spam folder first!).
