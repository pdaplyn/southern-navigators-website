SN will host 3 afternoons of junior orienteering training in the Easter Holidays. Sessions will run from 1.30pm to 3.30pm each afternoon. There will be different activities each day to aid progression and juniors can choose to attend any one, two or all three.

The sessions are aimed at those running white / yellow / orange courses and aged 8-15. Older or more experienced juniors are very welcome to join us as role models and assistant coaches. Under-10’s must have an adult accompanying them, age 10+ may attend unaccompanied. Any junior who competes at the SN Saturday league events is welcome. Juniors from other clubs are also welcome subject to availability of places. There is no charge to SN juniors for the training sessions; for others the cost is £3 per session to cover printing costs.
 

If you wish to attend the training, please email Carol Lovegrove (carol.lovegrove@btinternet.com) by Mon 31 March 2025, with your junior’s name, age and which course they usually run (as an individual or pair), so that appropriate maps can be printed. Final details will be provided just before the session.
 

If you have questions, please contact Carol.
