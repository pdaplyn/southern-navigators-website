Congratulations to our British Sprint Individual champion and other medallists. Sarah retained her W45 title by an impressive margin. There were silvers for Tommy (M16) and Pete (M65), and bronzes for Mel (W50) and Sue (W55). All details here.

No medals this time for the relay teams, but it was a good warm-up for the individual races!
