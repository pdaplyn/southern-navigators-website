Thanks to everyone who ran the first ever SN MapRunF League on Elvetham Heath!

The technology was not always on everyone's side - unfortunately it's never going to be a perfect system. But I hope everyone enjoyed the courses and the chance to get out for a timed run.

Some people have been reinstated on inspection of their GPS trail, and I have taken David Roy's run on the long course to be his predominant result and will count that for league purposes.

Below are the "raw" results, but an age and gender adjustment will be added to calculate the Legaue.

The next courses will be released on 28th November, and will be on Bagshot Village.
