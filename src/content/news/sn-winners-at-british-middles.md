Congratulations to our British Middle Distance champions from the event at Rushmere on 6th March.

Sarah and Tommy Rollins repeated last year's family double in W45 and M16, while Pete Jones won his first ever British individual title in M65 - it's been a long time coming!
            

	    		
    		    

All three of our class champions were coincidentally running on the same course. Elsewhere there were other podium places for Charlotte Slade (3rd W14), Jocie Hilton (3rd W16), Clive Allen (2nd M80), Axel Blomquist (2nd M70) and local member Richard Barrett (3rd M50).

Full details of all the results can be found here. See Course 7 for the SN gold medallists.
