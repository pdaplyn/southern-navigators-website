With two successful Saturday Series events at Southwood and Horsell behind us, we are now putting together a more regular future events programme, and will need to find officials (organisers, planners) and teams of helpers to run them. Read more below for further detail.

Please also note that our events are moving to pre-entry only via Racesignup in order to minimise queues and close personal contacts (and helper effort) on the day. There will be discount codes for SN members and helpers (specific to each event). 

            

	    		
    		    

SN Trophy, 14 Nov: Organiser has recently sent an email update regarding helper requirements, with a few jobs still to be filled/allocated.

Future Saturday Series events (Wisley 27 Nov, Witley in Jan, Eagle House in Feb): Events Secretary has sent an email request seeking planners and organisers initially. Helper requests will follow nearer the time once organisers are in place. There has been a good initial response for prospective planners but the need for organisers is more pressing. Please respond to Events Secretary if you can assist, or would like further information about what is involved.

Larger events in 2022: not so urgent for Urban in July and SN Trophy next November, but it would be good to have organisers in place sooner rather than later in order to alleviate the burden on our Events Secretary, who can otherwise end up having to shoulder all the pre-event arrangements until such time as it can be delegated.
