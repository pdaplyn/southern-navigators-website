Medals are hard earned at any JK and 2025 was no exception. Few competitors had winning runs on all days as the different disciplines tested all our skills. SN's only overall individual winner was Sarah in W45, with victory in both sprint and middle distance and second in the long race. Ruth and Tommy got 2nd places in the Sheffield city centre sprint.

In the relays near Leeds we achieved a 2nd place in Senior Women (Katherine, Mel, Sarah) and a 3rd place in Veteran Women (Carol, Lucy, Sue).

In the UK's first biathlon medal competition there was a 2nd for Jake in Junior Men (16-) and a 3rd for Paul in Veteran Men (50+). The combination of orienteering and electronic rifle shooting was a very popular ancillary activity at JK25 and will hopefully be repeated at some future events.
