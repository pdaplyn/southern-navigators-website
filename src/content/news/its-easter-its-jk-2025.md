This weekend more than 40 SN members will be heading to Yorkshire to attend the UK's largest annual orienteering gathering: the JK Festival. You can absorb the scale and atmosphere of the weekend's activities by visiting www.thejk.org.uk , including links to the start lists and results in due course. With a city sprint on Friday, middle and long distance races at the weekend, and relays on Monday there should be plenty to follow on the live results pages. Look out for your favourite SN colleagues and cheer them on from afar!

            

	    		
    		    

The event attracts well over 2000 competitors, including many from overseas. Competition is tough, and all winners are worthy. This includes the relay races on Monday where SN will be fielding eight teams across seven of the classes. 

Each year the JK is held in a different region of the UK on a rotational basis. In 2026 it will be in Scotland and in 2027 it will be coming to the south east.

Like most UK competitions it is open to all, with courses to suit all abilities and preferences. If you don't fancy the trip to Scotland next April, look forward to 2027 when you will have a chance to experience this fantastic Easter weekend event on your doorstep. It would be great to see a new influx of juniors and recent new members among a very large SN contingent in 2 years' time, where we will also have a part to play in helping at the event.
