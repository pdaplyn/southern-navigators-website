Two SN members won medals at the recent World Masters Orienteering Championships (WMOC) held in Girona, Spain. Sarah was 2nd in W45 at the Sprint event, missing gold by just 6 seconds. Woo was second in the Middle distance, missing the top step of the podium by only 4 seconds! Two excellent performances nonetheless, and both of them also achieved highly respectable 4th places in the Long distance final.

Further details and photos can be found here.

WMOC is an annual event open to all orienteers over the age of 35, with associated public races for younger attendees. Next year's event is in Poland.
