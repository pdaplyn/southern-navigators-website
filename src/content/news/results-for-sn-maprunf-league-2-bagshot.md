Thanks to those who took part in our second SN MapRunF League, on Bagshot.

Below are the "raw" results, but an age and gender adjustment will be added to calculate the Legaue, once we've sorted the age adjustment for juniors.

The next courses will be released on 12th December, and will be in Farnham.
