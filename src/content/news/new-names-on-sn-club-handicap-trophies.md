Congratulations to Simon Dunkley who just pipped Ross Maclagan in a close finish at Bramshott on Sunday. Results are to be found via SLOW website here. Results by finish position have been circulated to all who ran - the first 30 finishers crossed the line within a 10 minute window, and the sun finally emerged just in time for the winner's presentation!
