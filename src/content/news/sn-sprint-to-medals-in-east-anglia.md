SN won two team silver medals in the British Mixed Sprint Relays at RAF Honington on 30 August, in the Veteran (40+) and SuperVeteran (55+) classes. Well done to Peter, Richard and Sarah (Vets), and Phil, Mel and Pete (SuperVets). 

In the individual championships at University of East Anglia (UEA) on 31 August there were golds for Sarah (W45) and Mel (W55) plus three bronze medals for Jake (M16), Jocie (W20) and Peter (M45).

A great weekend of fast action and exciting races, with brains severely tested by the complexity of the multi-level UEA campus. Congratulations to all our medallists. Full results and photos here .
