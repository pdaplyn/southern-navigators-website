British Orienteering (BO) start to process renewals for existing members from 1 November. Membership cards are usually distributed by email during December - check your inbox and spam folder. Please check your details carefully. (Read more below)

If you join as a new member on or after 1 November 2023 your membership will be valid up to the end of 2024.

If you have already set up a direct debit with BO your renewal will be automatic and payment will be taken during December. Otherwise please renew promptly when reminded by BO so our membership records remain accurate as we enter 2024.
            

	    		
    		    

Details of the BO element of the fee are in the BO news item here. The SN Club element of fees for 2024 are unchanged. 

The club relies on the information you provide to BO for our own membership records and communications, and it is also used by some online entry systems. In particular please check:

- your regional affiliation (SEOA or SCOA - your choice). This will affect your eligibility for regional leagues, squads, etc.
- your contact details. The club relies upon postal address, email and phone contact information from the BO database.

- your SI/SIAC and EMIT numbers. If you have recently acquired a new SI card or EMIT brikke please update your membership record. This information is used by some online entry systems and the SN Team Captain.

We look forward to you re-joining for another year. If you are a local member (i.e. you join BO through a club other than SN) you will be contacted directly by the Membership Sec regarding renewal.

The 2024 SN League starts early at our Wellesley Woods event on 9th December 2023. Entries for major 2024 events such as JK and British Championships will open soon and these events usually check via the online entry systems that your membership is current.
