At the British Relay Championships on 11 May, SN were victorious in the W50 class with a team comprising Woo, Sue and Mel.

At the Harvester Trophy night/day team relay on 29 June (being staged for the first time since 2018), SN finished a close second in the B Handicap Class (teams of five) after a race-long battle with a local SAXONS team.
