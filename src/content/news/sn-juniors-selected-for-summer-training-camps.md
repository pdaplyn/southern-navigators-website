Congratulations to four of our junior team, who have been picked for the summer tours run by the Junior Regional Orienteering Squads.
            

	    		
    		    

Fantastic performances in selection races this spring mean our juniors will benefit from quality terrain and coaching. The selections are as follows:

Charlotte L - Lagganlia

Charlotte S - Deeside

Tommy - Czechia

Jocie - Stockholm

These training camps select athletes from across Great Britain and aim to expose the athletes to outstanding terrain, as well as bring them together with other juniors their age. It's a big achievement to be selected, and we hope they all have fun and learn lots.
