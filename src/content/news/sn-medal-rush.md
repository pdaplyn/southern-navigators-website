Glorious weather, a new area, and some demanding courses made for a challenging and enjoyable weekend.

Congratulations to our individual long distance champions Sarah Rollins (W45) and Tom Bray (M35), and relay champions in Men Short (Nick, Pete D, Tommy) and Men 60+ (Axel, Paul, Pete J).

We also had six further medallists in the individual event with Silvers for Steve Keyes (M60), Mel Slade (W50) and Tommy Rollins (M16), and Bronzes for Jake Hilton (M12), Axel Blomquist (M70) and Clive Allen (M80).

Additional relay success included silver in M14 (Owen, Jake, Aidan), W14 (Charlotte, Livia, Charlotte), and W50 (Sue, Carol, Mel), plus a bronze in Women Premier (Frida, Katherine, Sarah).

Many club members also helped with car parking, and we provided the commentary team! Vocal support on the uphill finish was enthusiastic and helped many to keep running for that last 100 metres. A very successful weekend, and well done to all our medallists.
