We hope you all enjoyed the event at Hogmoor on Saturday. Results will be posted soon. We were without some of our usual expertise this weekend due to multiple prior commitments among our regular volunteers.

Congratulations to all of the prize winners from the 2024/5 Junior League and a big thank you to Gill for coordinating and administering both the scoring and the trophies. 

There will be a few informal events during the summer months, including some as part of our midweek "training" evenings, and the Saturday Series featuring the 2025/6 Junior League will return in September.
