Congratulations to our 2024 British Long Distance champions, Tom Bray (M35) retaining his title from 2023 by a margin of over 15 mins, and Jake Hilton (M14) winning his first national crown. See all the event results and photos at www.theboc.org.uk . Read more below for details of our other medallists.
            

	    		
    		    

In addition to our two new individual champions there were also medals for Tommy Rollins (3rd, M18E), Peter Taylor-Bray (2nd, M21E), Sarah Rollins (3rd, W45).

In the relay event there were silver medals in W18 (Charlotte, Charlotte and Jocie) and W50 (Woo, Carol and Mel), and a number of other notable individual runs which saw several of our other teams in contention for leading places during their races.

Well done to all our medallists and everyone else who made the long round trip to Whitby.
