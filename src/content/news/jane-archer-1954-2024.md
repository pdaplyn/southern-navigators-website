Jane passed away on 6 February 2024, a sad and premature loss to the world of orienteering and beyond. She had been a member of SN for over 35 years, supporting the club in many ways throughout that period. Always helpful, calm and quietly effective - she will be much missed by those who knew her.
            

	    		
    		    

Jane joined SN in 1988, part of a small group of work colleagues attracted to the sport through their love of the outdoors. During her time in the club she was always a willing volunteer and helped to organise events up to National level. She also served on the committee, with periods as both club secretary and fixtures/events secretary. In more recent years she assisted Calvin as equipment officer and helped to coordinate summer training activities.

Outside orienteering her love of the outdoors extended to long distance walks in the mountains, occasional canoeing and an annual skiing pilgrimage to the Alps. Her previous sporting interests included netball and badminton, and running with the local hash house harriers (with nickname "Calamity" - how inappropriate!). For a contrast she joined a local community choir where her vocal talent complemented her ability to play guitar, ukelele, piano and saxophone!

At work she was a respected IT infrastructure manager and has sometimes been called upon to apply some of her technical knowledge (and confidence!) to help resolve computer issues at registration and download.

Jane was truly a multi-faceted and multi-talented person, always modest and understated and so rarely flustered by anything. Her cheery no-nonsense manner will be remembered by all who met her. Such a lovely person to have known.

Our thoughts are with Calvin and Jane's families at this time. Funeral arrangements will be communicated to club members via email.
