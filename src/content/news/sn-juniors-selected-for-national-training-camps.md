Congratulations to Frank Townley, Tommy Rollins and Jocie Hilton, who have been selected to attend national training camps this summer.
            

	    		
    		    

Frank has been picked for the Gothenburg camp, Tommy has been selected for Lagganlia camp and Jocie will attend the Badaguish camp.

Congratulations to our selected SN juniors who have performed consistently at a high level in 2020 and 2021 and had great results in the recent Lake District selection races.

The Lagganlia training camp is based at the Lagganlia OEC near Aviemore. It is aimed at M/W14s and takes place around the last week in July. There are usually about 24 places for athletes on the camp, which provides the juniors with a week's worth of coaching in technical Scottish terrain. Lagganlia is organised annually by the Junior Regional Orienteering Squads (JROS).

The Badaguish training camp is based in the Lake District and organised by British Orienteering Federation (BOF) and is scheduled to take place between 24th and 31st July. The list of all juniors selected to attend this camp can be found here.

The “Gothenburg” training camp venue for 2021 is being looked at and a decision will be taken in July by JROS on where and how to hold it.
