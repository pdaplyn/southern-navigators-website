Try this jigsaw o-puzzle for size ..and see if you can solve inside 20 minutes (for the 100 piece option)

Or for a very trick one try this of Ash Ranges at 300 pieces

and the hardest Hindhead with rotated 300 pieces!!!

HINT: pieces are rotated by selecting with one click of the mouse and then right mouse click to rotate by 90 degrees
