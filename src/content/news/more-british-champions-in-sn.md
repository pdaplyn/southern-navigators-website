Congratulations to Sarah Rollins (W45), Tommy Rollins (M14) and Tim Beale (M35) who are the 2021 British Long Distance champions after the event at Braunton Burrows on Sat 2nd October. Full results details here .

Sarah and Tommy have achieved an amazing 'treble double' in 2021 after their earlier successes at middle and sprint distances.
