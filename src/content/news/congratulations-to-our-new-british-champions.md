SN had three individual winners in the British Long Distance championships at Cold Ash on Sat 25th March. Well done to Tommy Rollins (M16), Sarah Rollins (W45) and Steve Keyes (M60). Tommy and Sarah followed this up with overall victories at the JK two weeks later.

In the British relays on Sun 26th at Hambleden we did not secure any wins, but had one silver and three bronzes. At the JK Relays we successfully retained the W120+ title with a team comprising Katherine, Mel and Sarah.
