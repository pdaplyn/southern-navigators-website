CSC entry is done, and we won. BRC entry is done, and closing date JK Relays it's 20 Mar. 

Those who are running will be informed by email of team composition and running order. Entry fees were indicated in earlier emails. Information regarding how to pay for all three events will be sent once relay team selections are confirmed.

            

	    		
    		    

If you are not yet on the club mailing list or did not receive the email please contact the Membership Secretary.

The cost to competitors is subsidised in line with the recently updated club policy for entry fee subsidies, and within the budget agreed by the committee.

The response deadlines are to ensure that we can obtain cheaper entries. There is no guarantee that we will enter additional teams after the initial cut off date, and late responders may be charged more.
