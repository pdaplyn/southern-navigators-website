Get your orienteering fix with a selection of Solo-O and MapRunF courses for you to complete at your own pace and in your own time. SN reminds all members of the club and O community that any participation should be done totally in line with the current restrictions regarding COVID-19. 

National guidelines say that "If you need to travel you should stay local – meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live". 

For complete details please see both the government and BO web pages
            

	    		
    		    

If you need maps printed for you - Colin will provide this service at a small charge (£1.40 postage and .35p per map), please email him directly (courses@armyorienteering.com)
