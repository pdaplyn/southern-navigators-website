SN will host an afternoon of junior orienteering training at October half term. The session will run from 1.30pm to 3pm.

The session is aimed at those running white / yellow / orange courses and aged 8-14. Older or more experienced juniors are very welcome to join us as role models and assistant coaches. Under-10’s must have an adult accompanying them, age 10+ may attend unaccompanied.

            

	    		
    		    

Any junior who competes at the SN Saturday league events is welcome. Juniors from other clubs are also welcome subject to availability of places. There is no charge to SN juniors for the training session; for others the cost is £3 to cover printing costs.

If you wish to attend the training, please email Carol Lovegrove (carol.lovegrove@btinternetcom) by Tues 21 October 2025, with your junior’s name, age and which course they usually run (as an individual or pair), so that appropriate maps can be printed. Final details will be provided just before the session.

If you have questions, please contact Carol.
