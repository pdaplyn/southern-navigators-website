Our junior team of over 20 runners finished 4th in the delayed 2020 final of the Yvette Baker Trophy at Westonbirt Arboretum on 4th July. Thank you to Mel and others for marshalling the team, and to the juniors themselves for their great team spirit and clear enjoyment of the occasion.
            

	    		
    		    

The teams that finished ahead of us (SYO, BOK, WCOC) are all giants of junior orienteering, so there is no shame in 4th place! There were some magnificent individual performances. Full details and results can be found here.
