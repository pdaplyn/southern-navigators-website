Congratulations to Heidi (Juniors), and then Ruth (Women) and Tim (Men) - our Club Champions for 2024, and a first senior family double since 1995.

Read more below for further details.
            

	    		
    		    

Heidi won a tricky Orange course at SN's Witley and Mare Hill event on 12th October to add another new name to the junior trophy. Runner up was Eve, and full results are here.

Senior champions were crowned at TVOC's Hodgemoor Woods event on 20th October. Tim retained his title from 2023 to gain his third overall win, but was pushed hard by Pete, who led until a couple of shaky controls at half distance on the Blue course. Ruth was also level pegging with runner-up Carol at the midpoint on Green, but maintained greater strength in the latter stages to add her name to the trophy again after a gap of 13 years. Both our winners made mistakes on the leg to the last control, but not big enough to throw their races away! Full results on the TVOC website here.

Well done to all our 2024 club champions.
