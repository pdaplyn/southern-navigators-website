SN convincingly overcame TVOC and DEVON at the WSX Holmsley event on 22 Jan to earn a place in the final in the Forest of Dean in November. Thank you to everyone who ran/skated for the team. It was cold but it was worth it - well done! Results have been uploaded to BO results pages and should appear in due course on WSX website here.
