SN claimed a relay bronze and a total of five individual medals at the British Sprint Championships weekend. Read more below for the roll of honour. Full details at www.britishsprintchamps.org.uk .
            

	    		
    		    

The SN Veteran (40+) team of Sarah Rollins, Mel Slade, Richard Barrett won a bronze medal in the Mixed Sprint Relays. We were by far the quickest team with less than two men, and certainly not the youngest team in the race! Every team had to contain at least one woman, and most therefore chose to have two men on the longer 1st and 3rd legs and a woman on the shorter 2nd leg. A great team performance.

In the Individual races small errors of a few seconds often decided both the qualifiers and the finals. There was another Rollins family double, with both Sarah (W45) and Tommy (M14) adding British Sprint titles to their Middle Distance successes in June, both of them holding their nerve as last starters in their respective finals after being the fastest qualifiers.

Pete Jones repeated his British Middles achievement with a bronze in a very competitive M65 class (top 6 covered by just 49 seconds), and there was also a silver medal for SN local member Richard Barrett in M50 who demonstrated the benefit of a consistent error-free run (top 4 covered by only 28 seconds). Last but not least, a first major championship medal for Jake Hilton, silver in M12, staying ahead of the SYO boys who had been part of a podium clean sweep in the Under 12's relay the previous day.

Well done to all our medallists, and commiserations to all those who had "if only" moments in their respective finals. It felt great to be participating as Team SN once again, in a big event atmosphere after such a long break.
