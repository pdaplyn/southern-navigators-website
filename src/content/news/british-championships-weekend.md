Nearly 30 SN members will be in Cumbria for the British Long Distance individual championships on Sat 10 May, with seven SN teams in the forest Relay championships on Sun 11 May. It promises to be a demanding weekend, both physically and navigationally, on some top quality Lake District terrain. 

Follow the event via www.theboc.org.uk where there should be links to results and photos in due course. Good luck to all who are taking part!
