To quote our Chairman Alan, "we're not out of the woods yet (or even in them!)". Stay safe and look forward to 2021. Read more below.
            

	    		
    		    

As we approach the end of 2020 we are all feeling the frustration and disappointment that SN have not yet been able to stage any 'normal' events since February. The latest postponement of our Club Championship at Wisley was forced upon us at very short notice, but it's more important that we all stay safe and healthy in the short term, and look forward to better things in 2021.
 
 Whilst real orienteering opportunities remain few and far between for most of us, there are still things we can do locally or from the comfort of our homes, whatever tier of restrictions we currently find ourselves in.
 
 The SN Christmas quiz is available to download from here. Answers available to download from 8pm on Christmas day.
 
 It is not too late to enter the virtual Orienteering Unlocked competition here . Entries via Fabian4 are open until Wednesday 23rd for a multi-stage competition spread over the Christmas period. A chance to develop some of your skills without the physical exertion.
 
 Provided you can do so safely within your local travel restrictions, check out local solo-O and MapRun activities via the SN web site at here. Several new courses were added in the last few weeks, and most of the tapes are still in place for earlier courses set in October/November. Please be mindful that Tier 4 restrictions are effectively a "stay at home" regime, and you may only leave home and travel locally for the legitimate purposes listed in the government guidance here. Organised grass roots sports activity must cease under Tier 4 unless it is specifically for Under 18's or the disabled (only a few additional exemptions are permitted for local outdoor activities if we return to Tier 3 - the official guidance is here).
 
 We will bring back some real orienteering just as soon as we possibly can. In the meantime we wish all our members a peaceful Christmas, and hope that you and your families remain safe in these testing times. We will doubtless remember 2020 for all the wrong reasons, but to quote Captain Tom, we must continue to believe that "tomorrow will be a better day", and look forward to 2021.
 
 With best wishes from the SN Committee.
