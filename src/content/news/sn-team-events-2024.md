Please reply to the email (13 Jan) from Team Captain if you wish to run in any or all of Compass Sport Cup heat (18 Feb), JK Relays (1 Apr) or British Relays (14 Apr). Further details of events and entry deadlines are in the email. Entries will be partly subsidised by the club.

You need to be a paid-up 2024 BO/SN member to be eligible to run in any of these events, and to qualify for any subsidy offered. If you have not yet renewed your membership please do so before responding.
