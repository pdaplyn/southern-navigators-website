Thank you to Steve for organising/planning a super event at Hogmoor, and congratulations to our new club champions for 2021: Tommy (men), Frida (ladies) and Aidan (juniors). See the results links elsewhere for full details.

            

	    		
    		    

The courses were busy and convoluted, inducing navigational hesitations and errors for many. Some of our leading runners may have been absent due to international duties, injury or university commitments, but you can only beat the opposition on the day. We therefore have three very worthy new names on the trophies, with Tommy becoming our youngest ever Men's champion, a record previously held by Peter Bray (now a GBR international).
