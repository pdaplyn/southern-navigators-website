A recent true life story of a family recently joining SN ...
        
	    		
    		    

In 2012, a family with no previous experience of orienteering went to a series of local taster sessions. It was the start of an amazing journey which continues to this day. Beginning with SN's local events, before progressing to more challenging navigation in less familiar areas, they have been encouraged and supported by the members and experienced coaches in the club, including current and former international orienteers who are only too willing to share their knowledge and expertise.

Twelve years later, and the eldest child is in the GB junior team and has competed overseas at a world championship. The younger two have both achieved regional representation and been selected for national coaching and training camps. The whole family have made new friends and visited so many new places through the shared enjoyment of adventure running in wild forests and hills (and a few cities!).

The sport also attracts many with less lofty ambitions or a few more years under their belt. The joy of being outdoors among like-minded people with a map and a new navigational challenge is enough to bring them back time and again. You are never too young or too old to discover the simple pleasure and sense of achievement that orienteering brings, at whatever pace suits you, and all in a friendly club environment run entirely by volunteers.

If you never give it a try, you'll never know where it could take you. Let 2025 be the start of your orienteering journey.
