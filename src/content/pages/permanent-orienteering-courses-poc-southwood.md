Southwood Country Park

SN's third POC is now open to all, (Oct 2025) full details below.
        
	    		
    		    

Southwood Country Park (between Farnborough &amp; Fleet in Hampshire) offers a permanent orienteering consisting of 20 controls points scattered through the park. 

Access – there are 2 free car parks, one located at the east end of the country park, on the A327 (Ively Road) adjacent to the Chalk in the Park café (with toilets, dog washing facilities etc). Car Park entrance at What3Words ///really.silent.shut.
 

The other is the Kennels Lane car park near the junction of Ively Road and Kennels Lane. Car Park entrance at What3Words ///reduction.empty.spruced
 

 Southwood Country Park is made up of two areas, to the east (over the road from the Chalk in the Park café), is a fairly open area. Predominantly grassland with scattered trees. Parts of this area can become quite wet in the winter although there are numerous paths to help you navigate through this area. The other part of the area (to the west) is wooded with numerous paths, ditches, earth banks and man-made features (some used as control sites).

 The individual control sites are indicated by either a large round stake with a small plastic square plate displaying a QR code, code letter and control number.

There are 3 suggested courses for you to try
 

 
 

- The easiest course mainly keeping to the main paths, which is particularly suitable for those with wheelchairs or buggies
 
- An intermediate course, which take you off the main paths
 
- A harder course, which will take you to many corners of the area
 

 
 

You don’t have to follow any of these, of course, and you’re welcome to make up your own courses as you wish.
