There are 3 levels of Controllers (Grade A, Grade B, Grade C) that have slightly different responsibilities, however Controllers are responsible for:
        
	    		
    		    

- Ensuring the standards required for the event are delivered during the organising, planning, delivery and reviewing of the event
- The event and competition rules are adhered to

- Communicating with event officials using tact to influence the decisions the event officials take regarding the event

- Advice to event officials with regard to the potential pitfalls that should be guarded against

- Checking and advising on all aspects of the organisation of the event with the organiser and the planner

- Ensuring that the risk assessment has been carried out

- Ratifying the final paperwork for the event (final courses; course lengths and climbs; map corrections; control code allocations; course description sheets; overprinted maps)

- Providing feedback on all aspects of the event to organisers and planner

- The Event Officials handbook has information to support a controller in their role.
