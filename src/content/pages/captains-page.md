Notes
 

Most major team events (relay competitions, Compass Sport Cup) require entries to be coordinated via Team Captains.
 

When entry closing dates are approaching, the Team Captain will announce entry arrangements via the club newsletter, email and/or the club website, requesting the details that are required from those members who would like to run in SN teams.
 

Team selection will be based principally on the Team Captain’s judgement of the combinations of runners and classes that will give the club the best chances of success. It is also an aim that all who wish to take part will be able to participate in a team which best matches their ability and competitiveness, or will be members of Ad Hoc teams (usually mixed difficulty and leg length) to ensure everyone can have a run.
 

Individual preferences will be taken into consideration regarding team mates and running order where possible, and prospective team members may be consulted where choices are close or difficult. It is inevitable that the number of runners participating and the combinations of age/gender will not always work out perfectly.
 

Entry fee subsidies:
 

The club committee maintains a policy for subsidising the entry fees of SN teams running officially in recognised open competitions. These include Compass Sport Cup, British Relays, British Mixed Sprint Relays, JK Relays, Harvester Trophy, South East Relays and occasional other competitions (e.g. SOC Sunset &amp; Beyond relays, and UK Relay League events such as the Scottish Relay championships). The policy is published in the Club Policies section of the website here .
 

Specific subsidies are decided event by event, within an annual subsidy budget agreed by the committee. Eligibility is based on being a fully paid up British Orienteering member with SN as your first choice club, or if you belong to a “closed” club (such as BAOC or a university club) then you must be a paid-up local member of SN and not run for any other “open” club during the calendar year.
