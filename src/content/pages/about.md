The orienteering club for West Surrey, North East Hampshire and South East Berkshire; covering Aldershot, Alton, Bagshot, Bordon, Byfleet, Camberley, Crowthorne, Farnborough, Farnham, Frimley and Woking.
        
	    		
    		    

We have approximately 250 members.

The club caters for all levels of competition, from beginners to elite members of the club (some of whom have been selected to race for their country).

The club was awarded Clubmark status (the only national cross sports quality accreditation scheme for clubs with junior sections) in 2007 and renewed in 2012.

SN is one of the oldest established clubs in Britain being formed by Chris Brasher and John Disley in 1965.

SN maintains the permanent Orienteering course at Alice Holt (maps from visitor centre) and holds social events throughout the year.
