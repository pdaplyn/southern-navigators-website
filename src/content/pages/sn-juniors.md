Welcome to the Junior Section of the Southern Navigator’s website. In this section you will find all the information you need either to introduce yourself to orienteering or to plan for your next race.

Southern Navigators aims to attract beginners from all junior ages and to help all its juniors become more experienced orienteers. We have club juniors of all abilities. The club offers:

        
	    		
    		    

- Junior specific training sessions provided by one of our experienced coaches

- Regular orienteering events including courses specifically designed for beginner juniors, and

- Junior team events where all SN juniors can compete against junior teams from other local and national clubs.

This section of the website provides up to date news of the junior activities including notable recent achievements. There is an opportunities page giving more information to beginners and a calendar of specific activities and events that are particularly relevant to our juniors.

Please contact Laurence Townley at ltownley@btinternet.com for any specific questions but we hope to see you at our next junior activity whether it is training, an event or a team competition.

The club has a number of Junior awards presented at the end of the year, see the club awards page for the latest holders.

If you want to try and improve your understanding of map symbols try this map symbol quiz. Maybe you would prefer to check out your knowledge of pictorial descriptions (there the ones used at international events since not everyone understands English), then try this Description description quiz.
