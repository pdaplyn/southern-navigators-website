Background on financial guidance.
        
	    		
    		    

Policy: 

The Club shall aim to accumulate and retain financial reserves in order to facilitate investment in new maps and/or equipment as the need or opportunity arises, with the aim of recovering the cost of such investments through future events and activities. 
 

The desired minimum level of reserves is based on an estimate of the expenditure to produce a new map and/or replace substantially all of the equipment needed to stage an event in advance of recovering such costs through entry fee income. 

The policy will be reviewed from time to time by the Committee, and the level of reserves assessed annually as part of the accounts prepared for the AGM.

Background: 

The Committee reviewed the Club's finances (historical and projected trends of income and expenditure) thoroughly in 2022 and determined that an appropriate minimum level of reserves would be in the range £12,000 to £15,000. 
 

A major new professionally produced map is estimated to cost £6,000 to £8,000.

The replacement of substantially all the kit required to stage a major event (controls, IT kit, tentage, etc) is estimated to be up to £8,000 to £10,000 (some equipment could be borrowed from other clubs in the short term). The Club has chosen as a matter of policy not to insure its stored equipment due to the onerous limitations and exclusions of the insurance policy, and may therefore have to fund replacement at short notice. 

The desired minimum level of reserves is therefore an amount which would cover both of these eventualities simultaneously. The club constitution already ensures that the reserves and other assets of the club would pass to an organisation(s) with similar objectives should Southern Navigators cease to exist.
