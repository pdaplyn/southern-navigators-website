How the league will work

- Using the MapRunF app

- Two new courses released every fortnight (long and short)

- Open for 9 days, including two weekends. We will be collating results from this time period, although you can run it at any time.

- Scoring by time and using an age/gender adjusted score (thanks to Jon Magee!)

- Approx half of results will count (eg best 5 of 9 events, best 5 of 8 events)

- Urban races which cross roads - juniors aged 16 and under must be accompanied by an adult. We are looking at doing some park races more suitable for juniors.

        
	    		
    		    

Farnham LongUsing MapRunF

- The app can be downloaded for a smartphone, with GPS enabled. It will beep when you get to the location of the control.
 

- If you have a super-fancy GPS watch, you can download MapRunG and add it on there. Google it. I don't know how it works!
 

- The courses can be accessed by going to (e.g.) Select Event -&gt; UK -&gt; Surrey -&gt; ElvethamHeath_Nov20
 

- You will need the PIN number for the course (see below)
 

- It is highly recommended that you print the pdf of the map. It's much easier than looking at a phone, and the control circles are more accurately located.
 

- You can run the courses without MapRunF - just print the map and go. If you want, you can submit your time (to me at kathbett@gmail.com), but we may give you a time penalty for not using the app!
