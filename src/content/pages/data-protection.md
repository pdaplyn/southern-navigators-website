CLUB WEBSITE (www.southernnavigators.com)
 

We manage the content of our website, but the technical operation is managed by a third party. Use of the website means that some essential non-personal information is collected from you, such as browser, operating system, and requested pages. The server and server management software carries out some logging of IP addresses, mainly to identify errors or cyber-attacks, and collects some statistics on page views and visitor numbers, but we do not have ready access to such data. A session cookie is created when you access the website; it contains no identifiable information and will be deleted when you close your browser. Users with administration rights to the website have a persistent cookie set that monitors when they last logged in.

    		

			    		
    		    

GENERAL
 

We may collect, keep, and distribute your data in both electronic and paper form. We will take reasonable steps to ensure your data is secure. We will not provide your personal data to third parties, other than as indicated above, unless we have your consent or are required by law to do so.
 

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, implemented in the UK by the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the right to request to see any personal information we may hold about you – please contact the Club Secretary via the website in the first instance. We may ask you for appropriate identification, and some details of the source or location of the information you are requesting. If you discover that any of the personal information that we hold for you is incorrect, please contact us. You have the right to withdraw consent for use of your data, but in some cases this may mean that we can no longer provide you with the appropriate service. In some circumstances you may have the right to request deletion of your data. You have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office if you think we are not complying with the relevant legislation.
 

Data provided to us from other sources may also subject to the policies of those providers, which will differ from ours. If we have correctly provided data to third parties, or if you click on external links from the club website, then responsibility passes to those parties, and this privacy policy will no longer apply in respect of any data passed over.
 

We may change this policy as and when necessary; it is your responsibility to check periodically to ensure you agree with any changes.
