Permanent courses give you the opportunity to try out orienteering without any pressure. They can also be used by experienced orienteers for training.

A Permanent Orienteering Course is a perfect way for getting active, enjoying the scenery and green spaces with your family, or as a chance to get outdoors for a competitive time trial.

The challenge is to discover checkpoints in the form of posts or plaques, in forests, heathlands, parks and green spaces across the UK. The combination of physical and mental exercise often in stunning locations is like no other, and you can find, navigate and complete courses at any time, and at your own pace. You just need a map to get you started!

In Southern Navigators we have three such POCs, as given below but other information of POCs all around the country and details of what to expect can be found at Go Orienteering
