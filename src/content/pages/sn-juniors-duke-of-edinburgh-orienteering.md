 Orienteering is a challenging outdoor adventure sport. The aim is to navigate between control points marked on an orienteering map and decide the best route to complete the course in the quickest time. It does not matter how young, old or fit you are, as you can run, walk or jog the course at your own pace. Your local clubs Guildford Orienteers (GO) and Southern Navigators (SN) have teamed up to provide a program of events and support for those choosing orienteering for their DofE physical, skills or volunteering sections
