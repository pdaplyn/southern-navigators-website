Safety and Risk: A comprehensive risk assessment will have been carried out by the organiser. Competitors are responsible for their own personal safety and for assessing their own abilities to complete the course. Neither Southern Navigators, the landowner or British Orienteering can be held liable for any accident or other incident arising while undertaking the event. Participants take part at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety during the event - including clothing appropriate for the conditions, and if required, a means of summoning assistance (e.g. phone or whistle).
After forest orienteering, please check thoroughly for ticks and remove immediately if you find them. Lyme Disease is on the increase in the South East!

Insurance: All participants are covered by the British Orienteering third-party liability insurance policy. (NB: This is not a personal injury policy).

Privacy: If you enter an event or activity for which we publish results your name will appear in the results section of this website. In addition we may seek to have the results published elsewhere, e.g. by local newspapers. Read our data protection page to see how we look after your personal data.
