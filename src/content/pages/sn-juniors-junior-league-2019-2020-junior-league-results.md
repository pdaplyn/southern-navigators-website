Soon after the fifth event of the Junior League season, at Alice Holt on March 7th, all orienteering activities were stopped across the country. So we’ve called a halt to the league at that point, and awarded prizes based on the 5 events that did take place. Best 4 events to count; to be eligible for a prize you must have attended a minimum of 3 events. 3 par times gets you a certificate.

All the prize and certificate winners are listed below. Full results can be found on the results page of what turned out to be the final event: Alice Holt 2020 Results

Congratulations to St Andrews, who retained the team trophy, and to all the individual winners. Unfortunately, under the current restrictions we can't yet hold the usual prizegiving event. We will keep it under review, but it might have to wait until the first event of the 2020/21 season.
