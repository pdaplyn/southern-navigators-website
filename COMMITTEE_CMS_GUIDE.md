# Southern Navigators – CMS guide for committee

This guide explains how to log in and manage content (events, news, contacts) using the new site’s CMS. No technical knowledge or code is required.

---

## 1. Logging in

1. Go to the club website and open **/admin/** (e.g. `https://www.southernnavigators.com/admin/`).
2. Click **Log in with Netlify Identity** (or **Log in with GitHub** if that’s how the site is set up).
3. Enter the email and password that were set up for you.  
   If you don’t have an account yet, ask the technical contact to invite you (they add your email in Netlify Identity or GitHub).

## 2. What you can edit

After logging in you’ll see the CMS sidebar:

- **Events** – Add or edit club events (date, title, location, level, link to entries, etc.).
- **News & Archive** – Add or edit news posts (title, date, summary, body, categories).
- **Info pages** – Add or edit static pages (e.g. New to O, FAQ, policies).
- **Contacts** – Edit committee/role names and contact details.

## 3. Adding or editing an event

1. Click **Events** in the left-hand menu.
2. To add a new event: click **New Events** and fill in:
   - **Title** (e.g. “SN League – Star Posts”).
   - **Date** (use the date picker).
   - **Location** (e.g. “Star Posts, Bracknell”).
   - **Level** (Activity / Local / Regional / National / Major) if needed.
   - **External URL** (link to entries or event page) if you have one.
   - **Summary** (short line for the homepage; optional).
   - **Body** (full description; you can use the toolbar for bold, lists, links).
3. Click **Save** (or **Publish** if that option is shown).  
   Changes go live after the site rebuilds (usually within a minute or two).

To edit an existing event, click its title in the list, change the fields, then **Save** again.

## 4. Adding or editing news

1. Click **News & Archive**.
2. To add a new post: click **New News & Archive** and fill in:
   - **Title** (e.g. “SN success at Southern Championships”).
   - **Sub Title** (optional; e.g. “Star Posts, 25 January 2026”).
   - **Date**.
   - **Categories** (optional; e.g. Juniors, Events).
   - **Summary** (short text for the homepage; about 30–40 words).
   - **Body** (full article; use the toolbar for formatting and links).
3. **Save** (or **Publish**). Same as events, the site will update after the next build.

## 5. Editing contacts

1. Click **Contacts**.
2. You’ll see a list of **Roles** (e.g. Committee, Coaches). Each role has a list of **People** with Name, Email, Phone.
3. Use **Add** to add a role or a person; use the pencil icon to edit; remove entries you no longer need.
4. **Save** when done.

## 6. Images

When editing events or news you can add images in the **Body** using the image button in the toolbar. Images are stored in the site’s media library and will appear on the live site after you save and the site rebuilds.

## 7. If something goes wrong

- **Can’t log in** – Check you’re using the right URL (/admin/) and the email/password you were given. If you’ve forgotten the password, use “Forgot password?” if available, or ask the technical contact to reset it.
- **Changes don’t appear** – The site rebuilds automatically after you save. Wait a minute and refresh the main website. If it still doesn’t update, tell the technical contact.
- **Need a new editor** – Ask the technical contact to add your email in Netlify Identity (or GitHub) and send you the login link.

For technical or hosting issues, refer to **MAINTENANCE.md** or contact the club’s technical member.
