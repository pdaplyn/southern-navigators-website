## Verbatim user prompt (1 February 2026)

> I am the chairman of Southern Navigators Orienteering Club. Our website is at https://www.southernnavigators.com/ and the developer has told us the site and CMS is end of life. I want you to be our automated professional web development agency and replace the site and CMS, including migrating current content and building a CMS that I and other committee members can use to manage content without any technical knowledge. once built and deployed I want the maintenance and hosting costs to be minimized. produce a detailed plan of action that my technical club member can review & then give you the go-ahead to execute as autonomously as possible. make sure everything is documented (including this prompt) in order for the automation to continue seamlessly. Suggest other prompts where necessary. critique your own work. Ask if you need any more information or clarity on what to do. Ask if you need something created or enabled to continue. Here is the email from our current development agency: @c:\Users\Dad\Downloads\Gmail - FW_ SN website hosting.pdf. Here is a link to a screen-recording of the functionality and customization of the current CMS: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y5quQXl0frm8eJdhAwK4OgrqUIH0gaSG/view?usp=sharing
